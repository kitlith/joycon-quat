# joycon-quat

decoder (and encoder) for quaternions sent from a joycon. Based heavily on reverse engineering done by hexkyz.

for those who want to use it as a reference, I hope this is readable, but I may have gone a bit overboard on
using fixed point types.

can't be arsed to setup a LICENSE for this at the moment,
but I'll proabably go with something appropriately prermissive.
poke me if you care and I haven't gotten around to it yet.
